  <h1><b>BASHSHIP</b></h1>
  <p>A minimal, fast, and customizable Bash prompt.</p>
</div>

## Introduction

Bashship is a minimal, fast, and highly customizable prompt for Bash. It is designed to be easy to install and configure, while providing useful information at a glance. Inspired by the popular [Starship](https://starship.rs/) prompt, Bashship aims to bring similar functionality built on pure Bash.

### Why Style Prompts Natively?

While on most systems a third-party prompt is not likely to cause performance issues, there are scenarios where a native Bash prompt can be beneficial. One such scenario is when working in constrained environments, such as Docker, Podman or LXC where resources are limited. In these cases, a lightweight prompt can help reduce overhead and improve performance.

The biggest issue with third-party prompts especially with posix shells like Bash and Zsh command history is often funky requiring some manual intervention to fix. This is especially true when the prompt is slow or buggy causing commands to be lost or duplicated. A native prompt can help avoid these issues by being more reliable and consistent.

Additionally, a native prompt can be more secure as it does not require executing external binaries which may be compromised or contain vulnerabilities.

One of the main goals of Bashship is to be fast and lightweight, this is done be minimizing the number of external dependencies and limiting the amount of work done in the prompt. Even **Starship** would move slowly if doe to excessive git status checks in large repositories and loading of multiple modules.

## Features

- **Minimal and Fast**: Designed to be lightweight and efficient, ensuring quick load times.
- **Highly Customizable**: Easily configure the prompt to suit your preferences.
- **Git Integration**: Displays the current Git branch and status.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on any system that supports Bash.
- **Container Awareness**: Indicates if you are inside a containerized environment.
- **Modular Design**: Add or remove prompt components as needed.

## Installation

The recommended way to install Bashship on Debian/Ubuntu based systems through the package manager. To do so follow the instructions below, on the [archive page](https://archive.mlstidbits.com).

```bash
echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/MLSTidbits.gpg] https://archive.mlstidbits.com/ stable main" |
sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/MLSTidbits.list

wget -qO - https://archive.mlstidbits.com/key/MLSTidbits.gpg | sudo dd of=/usr/share/keyrings/MLSTidbits.gpg
```

Then update your package lists and install bashship:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install bashship -y
```

Once installed, you can enable Bashship by adding the following to the bottom of your `~/.bashrc` file: `source /usr/bin/bashship
`.

Then, restart your terminal or run `source ~/.bashrc` to apply the changes. You should now see the Bashship prompt in your terminal.

## CONFIGURATION

By default, `bashship` loads the a basic configuration if **user configuration file** is not found at `~/.config/bashship/bashship.conf`. To create a user configuration file, copy the default configuration file from the installation directory to `~/.config/bashship/`:

```bash
touch ~/.config/bashship/bashship.conf
```

The configuration file is a bash script that sets various variables to customize the prompt. Below are some of the key configuration options available in `bashship.conf`:

Below is an example configuration file with explanations for each option. To learn more about each option, please see `/usr/share/bashship/bashship.conf` or the http://github.com/MLSTidbits/bashship repository.

## Configuration Options
